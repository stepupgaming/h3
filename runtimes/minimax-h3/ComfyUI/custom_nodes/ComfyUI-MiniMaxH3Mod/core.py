core.py — "RefMod" adapter for MiniMax H3 (no training required)

The reference-video path of MiniMax H3 works by injecting *reference tokens*
into the packed sequence: the ref is VAE-encoded, patchified, projected and
placed on the 3D RoPE grid, then every DiT block attends to it.  A video ref
is expensive because it contributes thousands of tokens.

Mode naming: ``encode`` (was ``full``) = straight full-res VAE encode;
``training`` (was ``pooled``) = compressed grid refined by gradient steps
(the only mode that "trains" — the refinement loop).  The old names are
accepted everywhere as legacy aliases so saved workflows and mods keep
working.

A RefMod is the same reference, compressed to a handful of tokens:

  * the ref is VAE-encoded to its full latent [1, 24, T, H, W],
  * the latent is average-pooled to a tiny grid (default 4x4) and a few
    latent frames, so the patchified token count drops to ~4-16,
  * optionally the small latent is refined with a few gradient steps that
    reconstruct the full latent (still no model weights involved).

At generation time the pooled latent is handed back to the model through the
native ``refs`` payload, so it flows through the exact same per-block
attention machinery as a full reference — the only thing that changes is the
token budget.

This is the MiniMax H3 analog of the LTX "Mod" concept tokens + per-block
injection: instead of a trained hypernetwork predicting AdaLN deltas, the
model's own cross-attention over the compressed ref tokens does the work.

        Build the ref block dict the model's ``PackedLayout`` / payload consumes.

        The shape mirrors what the native ref2va nodes emit, so the pooled
        latent rides the exact same path: ``cond_video_latents`` -> patchify ->
        ``video_patch_proj`` -> packed sequence with a 3D RoPE grid.

        ``strength`` weakens the ref by mixing the latent toward a heavily
        blurred copy of itself (see ``_blur_latent``) rather than toward
        zero or random noise: scaling toward zero pushes values out of the
        normalized latent distribution (reads as grey output), and mixing
        toward random noise reads as real-but-garbled content and decodes
        as a wrong texture rather than "weaker" — a blurred copy stays
        on-manifold while still discarding the specific detail that makes a
        reference strong. ``strength <= 0`` drops the block entirely (no
        tokens injected).

        ``curve`` (optional) is a per-frame strength spec for the ref's
        latent timeline — a ``(direction, shape, value)`` tuple (e.g.
        ``("concept_at_end", "ease", 1.0)``), a legacy preset name, a list of
        per-frame floats, ``(x, y)`` control points, or any object with
        ``interp(x)`` (see ``curve_strengths``).  Each frame is mixed with
        its own strength ``retention * curve(x)`` instead of one flat value,
        so the ref can fade in/out across the video.  A flat curve is
