# VERSION: v3.10.8-fracgrid (2026-08-19) -- pixel PLACEMENT fix: H3 renders the drawn pixel grid at a FRACTIONAL pitch when imitating a ref's cell count (live run 4788d88fa5: 704px gen, ref 820x721 @ 10px blocks = 82 cells -> true pitch 704/82 = 8.585; integer s=9 detection drifted ~0.46px/cell = art pixels one cell off near the edges; within-cell std 3.81 vs 0.74, edge recall 0.51 vs 0.995). GridRecover auto now refines to the fractional lattice (energy-weighted edge recall, both-axes gate >= 0.60 and >= 1.35x the integer recall; per-frame phase measured as noise -> global lattice) and reduces with area-weighted masked trimmed means on the true cell windows. Integer path untouched when no fractional lattice is proven (control run 7acc0e3dc1: gate 1.22x < 1.35x). v3.10.8b: the never-live v3.10.8 raw-recall scan crowned a degenerate p=3.0 comb on live run 10fb29c43f (recall 1.000 on a gen with NO global lattice = 234x234 grid); candidates now score by EXCESS over chance coverage 2*tol/p (true lattice +0.67..+0.72, false fine combs +0.04..+0.40, no-lattice gen +0.34; gate >= 0.45 both axes) + the pf_grid frac sanity gate read the X offset from the Y tuple slot (fixed). v3.10.8c: the recall tol plateau placed cells with median err 11/13.8% off on ground-truth synthetic (detector is not a fitter) -- after the excess gates pass, pitch+phase are now FIT by minimizing alpha-weighted within-cell variance (Gauss-Seidel, bincount stats, cheap-gates-first so integer/no-lattice gens never pay). FINAL: the reduce is pixel-CENTER assigned with the integer path's median-anchored trimmed mean per cell -- the area-weighted mean from the never-live a-c iterations mixed 6-12% neighbor color into every cell (measured median err 9 on a perfect ground-truth frame; center-assigned: 0).
# VERSION: v3.10.7-snapalways (2026-08-19) -- owner 21:18: 'why is there still a million gradients in the output' on live run 29f130e30a (v23, no LoRA, fresh seed): the gen drifted far off-palette (0%% exact-ref px, median redmean 61-125 across frames) -> the v3.8.8 guard tripped -> look == grid passthrough (3,580 unique colors at f0, ZERO color consolidation). Preset now snaps ALWAYS when a ref is armed (guard trip downgraded to a loud WARN line); explicit adv_gn_ref_snap=on keeps the legacy guard-gated mode, off = never. Color mapping is deterministic per color, so always-snap stays temporally consistent across frames.
# PREV: v3.10.6-snapall (2026-08-19) -- measured on live run 01c8045328 (sasuke ref, 56f): v3.10.5's cap-45 kept 39%% of px as gen gradient mush (f0 379 unique colors / 60.7%% exact-ref; f30 1450 colors / 32.9%%) and the 25%%/min-4 rescue gate never fired on the eye glints (measured 11-17%% support = 4-6px in a 36px full-res window). (1) SNAP-ALL: when the run-level dual-read guard passes (gen matches the ref), EVERY opaque block snaps to the nearest ref color -- cap preset 45 -> 1e9 (adv_gn_snap_cap still takes an explicit cap for foreign-prop content). True 1:1 colors with the input. (2) RESCUE GATE: light-extreme support threshold 25%%/min-4 -> 10%%/min-3 -- recovers the eye glints and de-tints cyan-shaded white shirt cells (measured 8-39%% support on mush cells). Green sweep unchanged (0 green-dominant opaque px on all 56 keyed frames of 01c8045328).
# PREV: v3.10.5-refsnap (2026-08-19) -- gen-native default-settings 1:1 push, measured on live run 2293e1bd04 (sasuke ref). (1) REF SNAP: with a ref armed (wired custom_palette_image or OneForge's auto-fed drawn_ref_image), the flattened native blocks snap onto the ref's EXACT modal palette (redmean argmin, cap 45 so foreign props keep gen colors; the v3.8.8 dual-read guard skips the snap on a foreign gen) -- kills the block-median gradient mush (f0: 704 unique colors in 927 opaque px, 4.6% on a ref color, median dist 19.3 -> 13 exact ref colors). (2) EXTREME RESCUE: the block median eats 2-3px light details (the eye glint: 1574 near-white px at keyed res -> 32 at grid res); a light-extreme ref color with >=25% support in a block's full-res window now wins the block. (3) GREEN SWEEP: post-keying, strongly green-dominant opaque px (G>R+25 & G>B+25) are keyed out when the ref palette carries no green (or refless when the screen itself was green) -- kills the detached/shadow-drifted green residue the border flood + temporal vote miss (f28-32: 400-1200 px/frame). New tail widgets adv_gn_green_sweep / adv_gn_ref_snap / adv_gn_snap_cap (preset = on; pf_oneforge passes no new keys -> presets apply, old workflows unaffected).
# VERSION: v3.10.2-genartdensity (2026-08-19) -- gen-native mode now reduces the guard-kept Source grid to the ref ruler's pixel-art density (the v3.8.2 refdensity block geometry: block = char height px / ref char cells; masked majority-reduce straight from the full-res keyed frames) -- DENSITY ONLY: palette still quantized from the gen itself (Hi-bit), RefMatch still skipped. Owner verdict on live f4c6a9c0cf (gen-native kept the 176x176 native grid, char 63x137 cells): 'not 1:1 as its pixel art representation'. No ref wired -> keeps the guard-kept grid (unchanged). Legacy ref snap byte-path untouched (harness D: max|diff| 0 vs .bak_v3102). v3.10.1b-limbgate (limb rescue now gated to comps adjacent to the main subject -- painted ground shadows on keyed light fields were color-'rescued' = full-frame crops) + v3.10.1-autokey2 (2026-08-19) -- 'auto' chroma key samples the FULL BORDER RING and keys every dominant border color (was: corner median only -- run 20818cd458 white studio field 69% + green letterbox bars: corners landed in the bars, only green keyed, white field stayed opaque as 'content' = whole-frame crop, palette eaten by whites, limb-rescue kept 75,615 detached white px = 72.2s keying > 67.9s generate). One shared Lab per frame per pass; despill per key; report self-reports detected keys. v3.10.0 note: (2026-08-19) -- new tail widget adv_ref_look_mode (after adv_ref_backdrop): "Gen-native (1:1 with the H3 gen)" (DEFAULT) keeps the guard-kept Source grid and quantizes the palette from the gen itself via the Hi-bit/TruePixel engine -- refdensity's 1:1-with-ref halving (live 1bac01576b: size guard kept 176, refdensity forced 88, 99-100% ref palette, -67% edges vs the H3 source = "detailing way off from the H3 output") and RefMatch's ref-palette snap are SKIPPED. "Reference look (legacy ref snap)" = byte-identical pre-v3.10.0 behavior. pf_oneforge tail re-order (adv_ref_backdrop, adv_ref_look_mode) keeps v21 119-value workflows aligned (missing trailing value = default = Gen-native).
# VERSION: v3.9.0-guardquorum (2026-08-19) -- the pooled dual-read ref guard false-tripped on live 6b7e1105f3 (Sasuke + a giant lavender sleeping bag: pooled core 27.2% / median 95.7 > 75 -> silent Hi-bit fallback at the guard-kept 176x176 Source grid = "density way too high, colors in wrong areas"). Now ALSO a per-frame quorum: pass when the pooled read passes OR >= 1/3 of frames individually pass (measured on all 9 preserved runs: matching quorum 46-100%, foreign f62d944eee/0e9d79c09e 0%). Also (pf_oneforge): v3.9.0-turbosteps clamps steps >8 -> 4 when a turbo LoRA is armed (288.8s -> ~100s generate).
# VERSION: v3.8.8-guardcore+phases (2026-08-18) -- (1) the v3.8.7 median-only ref guard false-tripped on MATCHING gens with a big foreign prop (live e49f434bfa/0d79b30fd6: Sasuke + giant cake = median 62-63 > 60 -> silent Hi-bit fallback). Now dual-read: core-within-30 >= 27% AND median <= 75 (measured on all 7 preserved runs: matching core 32-43% / median 39-63, foreign core 1-23% / median 86-130). (2) phase self-report: every pipeline section emits pf_studio_phase + a console line, the node shows a live phase strip at its top, and section durations land in the forge report.
# VERSION: v3.7.9-truecolors (2026-08-18) — the "inner" outline was the black-crush/eaten-sprite bug: on a small art grid (78x77) the inner silhouette ring is ~9%% of the sprite; repainting it near-black ate thin limbs + read as holes (measured on real v9 run uid b77f508dce: outline ON mean|d| 58 vs grid, ~700 near-black px; OFF 25.8 / ~200, colors match the gen). Default outline now OFF (H3 already draws its own outline; adv_tp_outline can force it). Subject palette share 0.75 -> 1.0 (wired alpha = invisible backdrop; the 4 bg clusters were pure transparent-black bases that black-holed dark shading px).
# VERSION: v3.7.8-regionvote (2026-08-17) — TruePixel classifies base+band from a 3x3-median signal (per-px argmin on 95%-speckle grid-res input = deepfry), 2x 3x3 majority region vote on the final class map, thin dark lines + inner ring snapped to ONE global outline color (unbroken black outline, no navy patchwork), grid report prints block/offset, full-res source frame dump for forensics
# VERSION: v3.7.7-pixelpure (2026-08-17) — Hi-bit cel flatten 5.0->0.0 (bilateral at art-grid res blurred clean pixels into mixel mush, the non-Hi-bit looks already knew: "flatten at art-res eats outlines"), TruePixel inner outline preserves existing near-black px (was repainting hand-drawn black outlines with base-color shadow shades = navy outlines on blue hair)
# VERSION: v3.8.9-detailvote (2026-08-19) -- RefMatch region_vote OFF at ref density: the 3x3 majority vote was tuned for the 2x-density grid (v3.8.2 speckle problem); at the 1:1 ref-density grid it eats real features (measured on d9952bcdfd: -18.7% of the reduce's surviving edge px batch-wide, 31.5 -> 36.2 edges/100cells vs ref 59.1, +0.9% speckle cost). despeckle stays on. Also (pf_studio.js): the A/B button now splits H3-source vs forge composite in the layers path (st.imgs.source built from pf_debug_stages.source) and the STAGE panel shows final-stage meta instead of "no stage data".
# VERSION: v3.8.7-refguard (2026-08-18) -- (1) gen<->ref compatibility guard on the Reference look: median redmean distance of opaque grid px to the ref palette > 60 falls back to Hi-bit cel instead of force-snapping a foreign gen onto the ref palette (live f62d944eee: H3 drifted to a dark ninja on the Sasuke seed; olive->black, navy->royal blue, red armband->magenta; measured med 124 vs 23 for a matching gen). (2) refdensity block from the pose-STABLE axis (character height) - the mean of w/h ratios let backflip action frames inflate the block (live 8b3edef07b: width term 14.9 vs height 8.3 -> block 12 -> 58px grid -> character 45 cells vs the ref's 64 = the 'details lost / shading not 1:1' verdict).
# VERSION: v3.8.6-bandmatch (2026-08-18) -- RefMatch band boundaries from the ref's own band-usage proportions (pf_finalize); fixes the output landing systematically darker/dirtier than the ref (light skin 0.7% vs ref 2.3%, tan 4.9% vs 3.0% on live aaf19735ff). Batch-pooled quantiles = no flicker. Achromatic path untouched.
# VERSION: v3.8.5-shadeboundary (2026-08-18) -- adv_ref_backdrop preset flips ON -> TRANSPARENT (owner v14 verdict: 'its not keying the bg'; pre-refmatch sprites 00085-00095 were transparent, refmatch-era baked #F6F6F6 opaque). The flat ref-color bake stays available via adv_ref_backdrop=on. Also see pf_finalize v3.8.5: boundary-vs-interior near-black rule (v3.8.4's component-thickness rescue navy'd whole outline stroke networks).
# VERSION: v3.8.2-refdensity (2026-08-18) -- the Reference look now matches the ref sprite's character-relative block size: measured on run cc3e40f8d9 the default output was 4.06x the ref's cell count (62x137 vs 30x65 character cells), so per-cell palette classification of the soft gen speckled every shading gradient and doubled every line. The forge grid is now derived from the ref's own integer-grid geometry (block 6 -> 85x85 for the 512px Sasuke run = 1:1 chunk) via a masked majority-reduce straight from the full-res keyed frames. Source-anchored size presets only; fixed/custom sizes untouched.
# VERSION: v3.8.1 (2026-08-18) -- TWO root causes of the "wrong colors / lost detail / blobby" v11 verdict, both measured on live run 1123616ebe: (1) fringefix: the v3.7.6 fringe snap capped the green channel of the WHOLE batch (missing mask), darkening every bright saturated px one shade band before the look stage (proven pixel-exact: bug repro == live look temps, 0 diff, 56/56 frames); now masked to the dark-green px only. (2) blackguard (pf_finalize PixelForgeRefMatch): chromatic dark-navy shadow px redmean-argmin'd to pure black = shade regions voided into black blobs; black is now reserved for near-neutral/near-black px (max>=32 & chroma>=25 reassigned to nearest non-black ref color; black 22414 -> 15079 px/56f).
# VERSION: v3.8.0-refmatch (2026-08-18) -- new suite look "Reference (match ref sprite)": snaps the forged frames onto the armed ref sprite's EXACT palette (integer-grid modal reduce, no kmeans, no shade ramps) + optional flat ref-color backdrop (adv_ref_backdrop). Measured on run 429e8cc342: kmeans+ramp dropped the ref's rare colors (magenta d=164 off) and Dulled everything through derived ramps; direct snapping restores exact colors + the flat chunky read. OneForge auto-feeds the armed ref slot (drawn_ref_image) when the look is selected.
"""PixelForge Super Forge — the all-in-one workspace suite node.

One node, whole pipeline, with a full in-node studio UI (canvas, timeline,
transport, stage inspector — see web/js/pf_studio.js). Wraps the exact same
battle-tested engines the Easy v2 suite uses (pf_sprite / pf_grid /
pf_pixelize / pf_finalize / pf_temporal); nothing here duplicates engine code
and nothing existing is modified — this file is purely additive.

What sets it apart from Sprite Studio (Easy v2):
  - FULL parameter surface: every Easy knob plus the advanced engine params
    Easy hides, as adv_* overrides with a "preset" sentinel (-1 / "preset"
    means: use the value the main knobs would pick).
  - Stage capture: after every pipeline stage the frames are written to the
    temp preview dir and shipped in the ui result as `pf_frames`/`pf_meta`
    (flat lists — dict-valued ui keys do NOT survive the server's ui merge,
    see the SERVER FLATTEN note near the return), so the frontend can show
    source -> keyed -> grid -> look -> motion -> final side by side. This is
    the direct answer to "the processed output looks worse than H3's raw
    video" — you can see exactly which stage loses it.
