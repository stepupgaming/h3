"""ComfyUI nodes for the MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA (4-step audio-video).

Drops into the stock MiniMax-H3 workflow (t2v and i2v):

  MiniMaxH3TurboLoRA    MODEL -> MODEL   applies the turbo LoRA
  MiniMaxH3TurboSampler       -> SAMPLER 4-step sampler for SamplerCustomAdvanced

On older ComfyUI the sampler steps the video and audio streams on their own flow
schedules (video shift 12, audio shift 3), because a stock single-schedule sampler
over-steps the audio at 4 steps and it breaks. Recent ComfyUI resolves that dual
schedule natively (ModelSamplingAV), so this sampler auto-detects it and falls back
to a plain single-schedule step, avoiding a double-shift that would corrupt the
audio. Either way it drops into the same workflow slot.

    Why not a wrapper module: replacing the whole AdalnProj with an nn.Module that
    holds the original under .base injects a `.base` submodule (and its
    `.base.linear.weight`) into the model's parameter/buffer tree. ComfyUI's

    Patching only the .forward attribute keeps adaln_proj.linear.weight at its
