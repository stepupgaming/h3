"""Temporal stabilization: kill pixel creep/crawl without touching real motion.

H3 redraws edges slightly differently every frame; after grid recovery each
art pixel is clean per-frame but OSCILLATES across frames (crawl). This node
runs a per-pixel temporal filter over the batch:

  despike (default): non-causal lone-1-frame-blip removal — a pixel only
  changes when its color differs from t-1 AND t+1 returns to t-1. Zero lag,
  cannot hold stale colors. Safe everywhere.

  movelock: motion-adaptive lock. Measures per-pixel motion from a
  PRE-quantize reference (motion_ref); pixels the source says are static
  collapse to their most frequent color + majority matte, moving pixels get
  despike. Kills interior shimmer and edge wobble without freezing motion.

  hysteresis (legacy): a pixel's committed color only changes when a new
  color persists for commit_frames CONSECUTIVE frames (and differs by more
  than threshold). One-frame blips never commit -> crawl dies; real motion
  persists 2+ frames -> passes through with commit_frames-1 frames of delay
  at most. Starvation escape: pixels that never return to their committed
  color for max_hold consecutive frames force-commit to the current color,
  so continuously-moving regions can't freeze on stale colors.

  median3: sliding 3-frame temporal median per pixel per channel. Cheaper,
  softer: also removes legitimate 1-frame events (muzzle flashes, impacts).

Place right AFTER Pixel Grid Recover (small true-grid frames = cheap and each
pixel is one real art pixel), BEFORE chroma key / quantize. Non-destructive:
separate node, 'off' mode is a bit-identical passthrough.
